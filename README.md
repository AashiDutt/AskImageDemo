# Google AI Edge Gallery

Google AI Edge Gallery is a mobile application designed to showcase the capabilities of Google AI Edge models, APIs, and tools. It serves as an interactive playground for developers and potentially tech enthusiasts to explore, experience, and evaluate various on-device ML models (primarily LiteRT-based) directly on their Android and iOS (coming soon) devices.
